UX Impact Analysis\n\n*   **Impact Area: Main Navigation**\n    *   **Change:** Add a new top-level menu item \"Blog Posts\" or a sub-item under an existing \"Content\" or \"Create\" section. This will lead to the \"My Blog Drafts\" list and the \"New Blog Post\" generation interface.\n    *   **Rationale:** Provides clear discoverability for the new feature and organizes content types.\n    *   **Risk:** Low - New menu item is additive.\n*   **Impact Area: Content Creation Workflow**\n    *   **Change:** Introduction of a new, dedicated workflow for blog generation and editing, distinct from existing social post creation. This will involve new screens for AI input, a rich text editor, and publishing configuration.\n    *   **Rationale:** Blog posts require different inputs and longer-form editing than typical social media posts.\n    *   **Risk:** Medium - Needs to be clearly separated but visually consistent with existing creation flows to avoid user confusion.\n*   **Impact Area: UI Components**\n    *   **Change:**\n        *   **New:** AI input field (text area), \"Generate Draft\" button, Rich Text Editor (WYSIWYG), WordPress connection modal/form, WordPress site selection dropdown, category/tag input fields (with autocomplete/search for categories from WP), publishing status dropdown, \"Publish Now\" button.\n        *   **Modified:** Potentially content calendar if blog posts are eventually integrated there.\n    *   **Rationale:** Specific controls are needed for AI interaction and WordPress integration.\n    *   **Risk:** Low - Standard UI components with clear purpose.\n*   **Impact Area: Information Architecture**\n    *   **Change:** Introduction of a new content type (\"Blog Post\") and its associated drafts and publishing channels. This implies a new data model and associated UI for management.\n    *   **Rationale:** Structure the new content logically within the application.\n    *   **Risk:** Medium - Careful consideration needed to ensure it doesn't clutter existing content views or lead to orphaned data.\n*   **Impact Area: Accessibility**\n    *   **Change:** All new UI components (input fields, buttons, editor, modals) must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This includes keyboard navigation, proper focus management, ARIA attributes for screen readers, sufficient color contrast, and clear error messaging. The rich text editor will require specific attention to accessibility, ensuring all formatting options are keyboard-accessible and content is structured semantically.\n    *   **Rationale:** Ensure inclusive design and compliance.\n    *   **Risk:** Medium - Rich text editors often pose accessibility challenges; requires dedicated testing.\n*   **Impact Area: Performance Feedback**\n    *   **Change:** Implement clear loading states and progress indicators for AI generation (which can take a few seconds) and WordPress publishing (due to external API calls).\n    *   **Rationale:** Provides user feedback and manages expectations during asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Risk:** Low - Standard UX practice.\n\n### 7. Integration Points\n\n*   **Integration: External AI Service (e.g., OpenAI API, Google Gemini API)**\n    *   **Purpose:** To generate creative text content for blog post drafts based on user-provided topics/keywords.\n    *   **Data Flow:**\n        *   `Application` -> (Topic/Keywords, Tone, Length parameters) -> `AI Service`\n        *   `AI Service` -> (Generated Text Content: Title, Headings, Body) -> `Application`\n    *   **Dependencies:** Valid API Key, rate limits, chosen LLM model version.\n*   **Integration: WordPress REST API**\n    *   **Purpose:** To connect to user's WordPress sites, fetch categories/tags, and publish blog posts.\n    *   **Data Flow:**\n        *   `Application` -> (WordPress URL, Username, Application Password/OAuth Handshake) -> `WordPress REST API` (Authentication/Connection)\n        *   `Application` -> (Post Title, Content (HTML), Categories (IDs), Tags (Names), Status) -> `WordPress REST API` (Create/Update Post)\n        *   `Application` <- (List of Categories, List of Tags, Post ID, Permalink) <- `WordPress REST API` (Fetch Categories/Tags, Post Confirmation)\n    *   **Dependencies:** WordPress site must have REST API enabled, Application Passwords plugin (if not core), user must have 'edit_posts' capability, OAuth client setup for secure connections.\n*   **Integration: Internal Content Storage Service/Database**\n    *   **Purpose:** To store generated blog post drafts, user edits, and associated metadata (e.g., topic, generation date, status, linked WordPress site info).\n    *   **Data Flow:** `Application` <-> (Blog Post Object: `id`, `user_id`, `title`, `content_html`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `wordpress_site_id`, `wordpress_post_id`, `wordpress_categories`, `wordpress_tags`) <-> `Database`\n    *   **Dependencies:** Existing data models for content, user accounts.\n*   **Integration: Internal Authentication/Authorization Service**\n    *   **Purpose:** To verify the identity of the user initiating blog generation and publishing, and to ensure they have the necessary permissions.\n    *   **Data Flow:** `Application` <-> (User Session Token) <-> `Auth Service`\n    *   **Dependencies:** Existing user management system.\n\n### 8. Technical Considerations\n\n*   **Consideration: Architecture Changes**\n    *   **Requirement:** Potentially new microservice (e.g., `content-generation-service`) to abstract AI API calls, handle rate limiting, and manage prompts. Secure credential storage service/module for WordPress application passwords/OAuth tokens.\n    *   **Impact:** Adds complexity but improves modularity, scalability, and security. Requires new deployment pipelines.\n*   **Consideration: Performance Implications**\n    *   **Requirement:** Asynchronous handling for AI content generation (can take 5-20 seconds). Implement webhooks or polling for long-running tasks. Caching of WordPress categories/tags. Optimize rich text editor for large content.\n    *   **Impact:** AI generation latency must be handled gracefully with UI feedback. WordPress API calls can be slow; needs robust error handling and timeouts.\n*   **Consideration: Scalability Requirements**\n    *   **Requirement:** Design AI service for concurrent requests. Database schema must support potentially large volumes of blog post drafts. WordPress integration must handle many connected sites and frequent publishing.\n    *   **Impact:** Careful API key management for AI service to avoid hitting rate limits. Database indexing for efficient retrieval of drafts.\n*   **Consideration: Security Considerations**\n    *   **Requirement:**\n        *   **WordPress Credentials:** Encrypt and securely store WordPress application passwords/OAuth tokens at rest and in transit. Implement strong access controls. Use OAuth 2.0 where possible for WordPress connections.\n        *   **AI API Keys:** Store securely (e.g., in a secrets manager), never expose client-side.\n        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs (topic, blog content) to prevent injection attacks (XSS, prompt injection for AI).\n        *   **Authorization:** Ensure users can only publish to their own connected WordPress sites.\n    *   **Impact:** Critical for protecting user data and preventing abuse. Requires robust security practices and audits.\n*   **Consideration: Monitoring and Observability**\n    *   **Requirement:** Implement logging for AI generation requests/responses, WordPress API calls (success/failure), and publishing events. Metrics for AI service latency, WordPress API response times, and feature usage.\n    *   **Impact:** Essential for debugging, performance optimization, and understanding feature adoption.\n\n### 9. Backward Compatibility Strategy\n\n*   **Compatibility Aspect: Existing Users and Flows**\n    *   **Strategy:** This feature is entirely additive. No existing content types, social media scheduling, or core workflows will be removed or altered. The new \"Blog Posts\" section will exist as a distinct, opt-in feature.\n    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Comprehensive regression testing on existing functionality. Clear separation in UI.\n*   **Compatibility Aspect: Data Model Changes**\n    *   **Strategy:** Introduce new database tables (e.g., `blog_posts`, `wordpress_connections`) and associated models. Existing content models (`social_posts`, `media_assets`) will remain untouched, but `media_assets` might be referenced by `blog_posts` for images.\n    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Use database migrations (e.g., Liquibase, Flyway) for schema changes. Thorough testing of data integrity for new and existing data.\n*   **Compatibility Aspect: Feature Rollout**\n    *   **Strategy:** Implement a feature flag (`blog_generation_enabled`) for the entire feature. This allows for a gradual rollout (e.g., internal teams, beta users, then general availability) and quick disabling if critical issues arise.\n    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Phased rollout reduces exposure to potential issues. Monitoring feature flag usage and error rates.\n*   **Compatibility Aspect: API Changes**\n    *   **Strategy:** New internal APIs will be developed for blog generation and WordPress integration. Existing APIs will remain stable.\n    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Versioning new APIs if necessary for future changes, clear documentation for internal consumers.\n*   **Compatibility Aspect: User Interface**\n    *   **Strategy:** The new \"Blog Posts\" navigation item and associated screens will be isolated. The UI will follow existing design system guidelines to feel native, but will not force changes to existing UI components or layouts for other features.\n    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Rigorous UI/UX review to ensure consistency and avoid negative impact on existing user experience."

    "full_text": "## Concept Paper: AI Blog Generator & WordPress Publisher\n\n### 1. Executive Summary\n\nThis concept paper proposes the integration of an AI-powered Blog Generator and WordPress Publisher feature into our existing social marketing application. This innovation will empower our users to significantly streamline their content creation workflows by generating blog post drafts using artificial intelligence and publishing them directly to their connected WordPress websites. The primary value proposition lies in drastically reducing the time and effort traditionally required for blog content production and distribution, thereby enhancing our application's utility as a comprehensive content marketing hub.\n\nThe strategic importance of this feature is rooted in the accelerating demands of content marketing and the competitive landscape. By leveraging cutting-edge AI, we address critical pain points such as writer's block, content creation bottlenecks, and manual publishing inefficiencies. This not only positions our application at the forefront of MarTech innovation but also fosters deeper user engagement and loyalty by providing an indispensable tool that consolidates key content activities. Expected outcomes include a measurable increase in user-generated blog content, enhanced content velocity for our clients, and improved user satisfaction, driving greater adoption and retention within our platform.\n\n### 2. Background\n\nThe digital marketing landscape is increasingly dominated by content. Businesses, from small enterprises to large corporations, rely heavily on consistent, high-quality blog content for SEO, thought leadership, lead generation, and audience engagement. However, the consistent demand for fresh content presents significant challenges: ideation takes time, writing is labor-intensive, and publishing often involves multiple platform switches. Our users, typically marketing managers, social media specialists, and small business owners, currently manage their social content within our platform but are forced to use external tools or manual processes for blog creation and publishing.\n\nThis fragmented workflow leads to inefficiencies and lost productivity. The rapid advancements in generative AI now present a timely opportunity to bridge this gap. By integrating an AI blog generator and direct WordPress publishing, we can transform our application into a more holistic content marketing solution. This strategic move aligns with current industry trends towards AI-assisted content creation and consolidated marketing platforms, offering a powerful competitive advantage and unlocking new value for our user base.\n\n### 3. Problem Statement\n\nOur users face significant challenges in blog content creation and distribution, leading to inefficiencies and unfulfilled marketing potential:\n\n*   **Time-Consuming Manual Content Creation (Productivity Loss):** Marketing teams spend an average of 3-5 hours per blog post, from ideation to final draft, significantly impacting content velocity and output scale.\n*   **High Barrier to Entry & Writer's Block (Content Bottleneck):** Users frequently struggle with generating fresh ideas or starting from a blank page, leading to inconsistent content schedules and missed opportunities for audience engagement.\n*   **Inefficient Manual WordPress Publishing (Workflow Disruption):** Copying and pasting content from various editors into WordPress, then manually adding categories and tags, is a repetitive, error-prone process that breaks workflow efficiency.\n*   **Lack of Centralized Content Hub (Platform Fragmentation):** Users are forced to switch between our social marketing app, word processors, and WordPress dashboards, leading to fragmented workflows and increased cognitive load.\n*   **Difficulty Scaling Content Output (Growth Limitation):** Businesses struggle to produce the volume of blog content needed to maintain SEO ranking and audience interest without significant resource investment.\n*   **Inconsistent Branding & Quality Control (Brand Risk):** Without a centralized drafting and editing environment, maintaining consistent brand voice and quality across all blog posts can be challenging.\n\n### 4.

HubSpot attempts it but can be generic. Semrush is SEO-first. Jasper is AI-first. Social tools like Agorapulse lack it entirely for blogs.\n*   **Seamless cross-platform content repurposing**: The ability to generate a blog post and then automatically (or with AI assistance) generate several related social posts from it, directly within the same platform.\n*   **Deep brand voice customization for AI**: While Jasper excels here, integrating this directly into a platform that also manages social messaging can create a truly cohesive brand communication.\n*   **Affordable, yet powerful, solution for SMBs**: HubSpot is expensive. Dedicated AI tools add another subscription. An integrated `Application` feature could offer significant value.\n\n### 3. Market Gaps & Opportunities\n\n1.  **Gap: Disconnected Content Workflows for SMBs & Agencies**\n    *   **Description**: Small marketing teams and agencies often juggle separate tools for social media management, AI content generation, and blog publishing, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs, and inconsistent brand messaging.\n    *   **Opportunity Size**: High (Millions of SMBs/Agencies globally)\n    *   **Feasibility**: High (Integrating existing tech, core user need)\n    *   **Competitive Advantage**: Offer a truly unified content command center that covers social and long-form blog content from ideation to publication, reducing tool stack complexity and cost.\n\n2.  **Gap: Lack of AI-Driven Content Repurposing**\n    *   **Description**: Marketers spend significant time manually adapting long-form content (blogs) into short-form social posts. Existing tools don't natively offer AI assistance for this specific, high-value task.\n    *   **Opportunity Size**: Medium-High (Every content creator benefits)\n    *   **Feasibility**: Medium (Requires advanced AI prompting and understanding of social platform nuances)\n    *   **Competitive Advantage**: Provide an AI feature that takes a generated blog post and suggests multiple social media captions, visuals, or even short video scripts, making content go further with less effort.\n\n3.  **Gap: Basic AI Output without Integrated SEO Guidance**\n    *   **Description**: Many AI content generators produce generic drafts. While Semrush offers SEO tools, and some AI tools integrate with them, there isn't a truly seamless \"generate and optimize\" experience for blogs *within a social context*.\n    *   **Opportunity Size**: High (Crucial for content performance)\n    *   **Feasibility**: Medium (Requires integration with keyword data and on-page SEO best practices)\n    *   **Competitive Advantage**: Generate blog drafts with real-time SEO suggestions, keyword density analysis, and readability scores *during* the editing process, ensuring higher-performing content from the start.\n\n4.  **Gap: Limited Brand Voice Consistency Across Content Types**\n    *   **Description**: Maintaining a consistent brand voice across social posts and blog articles is challenging. Current AI tools can adapt to a voice, but few integrate this deeply across multiple content formats managed by one platform.\n    *   **Opportunity Size**: Medium (Important for brand identity and recall)\n    *   **Feasibility**: Medium (Requires robust AI fine-tuning and user-defined brand guidelines)\n    *   **Competitive Advantage**: Allow users to define a \"Brand Voice Profile\" within the `Application` that applies to both AI-generated social captions and blog posts, ensuring consistency.\n\n### 4. Differentiation Opportunities\n\n1.  **Differentiation: \"Blog-to-Social\" AI Repurposing Engine**\n    *   **Competitive Advantage**: Directly addresses a key pain point by transforming long-form blog content into various social media formats (tweets, LinkedIn posts, Instagram captions, stories ideas) with AI. This is a unique, highly practical workflow not fully offered by competitors.\n    *   **Feasibility**: Medium (Requires advanced AI integration and UI design)\n    *   **Impact**: High (Significant time-saver, increases content reach, strong value proposition)\n\n2.  **Differentiation: Smart Content Optimization Assistant (SEO + Readability)**\n    *   **Competitive Advantage**: Go beyond basic AI generation by offering real-time, in-editor suggestions for SEO (keyword integration, H-tag optimization) and readability (sentence length, jargon detection) directly integrated with the AI generation and editing flow. Semrush offers similar, but not within a social app.\n    *   **Feasibility**: Medium (Requires NLP and SEO API integrations)\n    *   **Impact**: High (Helps users create higher-performing content, justifying value)\n\n3.  **Differentiation: Unified Content Calendar for Social & Blog**\n    *   **Competitive Advantage**: Most social calendars don't show blog posts. Blog-focused tools (like StoryChief) don't integrate social. A single calendar view for all planned content (social, blog) provides unparalleled strategic oversight and scheduling efficiency.\n    *   **Feasibility**: Medium (Requires robust calendar UI and backend to handle diverse content types)\n    *   **Impact**: High (Improves content planning, reduces scheduling conflicts, a key feature for marketing teams)\n\n4.  **Differentiation: Affordable All-in-One for the \"Mid-Tier\" Marketer**\n    *   **Competitive Advantage**: Position the `Application` as the most cost-effective solution that combines powerful social media management *with* robust AI blog generation and WordPress publishing, targeting marketers who find HubSpot too expensive and point solutions too fragmented.\n    *   **Feasibility**: High (Pricing strategy, requires careful feature bundling)\n    *   **Impact**: High (Broadens market appeal, attracts price-sensitive customers seeking integrated value)\n\n5.  **Differentiation: Interactive & Guided AI Prompting for Niche Content**\n    *   **Competitive Advantage**: Instead of just a text box, offer a guided AI generation experience with customizable parameters for industry, target audience, specific angles, and even competitor analysis, leading to more tailored and less generic blog drafts.\n    *   **Feasibility**: Medium (Requires a more sophisticated AI interface and prompt engineering)\n    *   **Impact**: Medium (Increases quality and relevance of AI output, appeals to users with specific needs)\n\n### 5. Pricing Models Analysis\n\n*   **HubSpot Marketing Hub**:\n    *   **Model**: Tiered Subscription (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)\n    *   **Price**: Starter from $20/month, Professional from $800/month.\n    *   **Value Prop**: CRM, marketing automation, email, landing pages, blog, social. AI assistance is a supplementary feature across tiers. Higher tiers include more advanced analytics, integrations, and greater contact limits. Blog functionality (hosting, editor) is core; AI for generation is an added helper.\n\n*   **Semrush Content Marketing Platform**:\n    *   **Model**: Subscription tiers (Pro, Guru, Business) + add-ons.\n    *   **Price**: Pro from $129/month, Guru from $249/month. Content marketing tools are included in Guru and Business plans. AI writing tools often use a \"credit\" system on top of subscriptions.\n    *   **Value Prop**: SEO research, keyword research, content optimization, AI writing for SEO. Value is tied to data depth and content performance.\n\n*   **Jasper**:\n    *   **Model**: Subscription tiers (Creator, Teams, Business) based on user seats and AI word count.\n    *   **Price**: Creator from $49/month (1 user, 1 brand voice), Teams from $125/month (3 users, 3 brand voices). Higher limits and custom features for Business.\n    *   **Value Prop**: High-quality AI content generation for various marketing copy. Focus on efficiency and creativity.\n\n*   **Agorapulse**:\n    *   **Model**: Tiered Subscription (Standard, Professional, Advanced, Enterprise) based on social profiles, users, and features.\n    *   **Price**: Standard from $49/month, Professional from $79/month, Advanced from $119/month.\n    *   **Value Prop**: Comprehensive social media management. Any AI features are typically for social captions and are bundled within existing tiers. No dedicated blog content features.\n\n*   **StoryChief**:\n    *   **Model**: Tiered Subscription (Team, Agency, Enterprise) based on users and content channels.\n    *   **Price**: Team from \u20ac110/month (1 user, 5 channels), Agency from \u20ac270/month (3 users, 15 channels).\n    *   **Value Prop**: Content collaboration, multi-channel distribution, editorial calendar. Price reflects workflow and publishing capabilities.\n\n**Pricing Gaps & Opportunities for \"Application\":**\n\n1.  **Mid-Tier Bundle Opportunity**: Many social media management platforms (like Agorapulse) lack native long-form AI content generation and direct CMS publishing. Dedicated AI tools lack comprehensive social management. There's an opportunity to offer a robust social + AI blog generation + WordPress publishing bundle at a price point significantly below HubSpot's \"Professional\" tier, appealing to growing SMBs and agencies.\n2.  **Value-Based AI Pricing**: Instead of just word count, consider pricing that reflects the *value* of the AI output (e.g., number of published blogs, or a fixed amount of AI assistance within a tier).\n3.  **Freemium/Trial for Blog Feature**: Offer a limited version of AI blog generation (e.g., 1-2 drafts/month) on existing paid plans, then upsell to an \"Advanced Content Pack\" for unlimited generation, full editing, and multi-WordPress site publishing. This hooks users without additional upfront cost.\n\n### 6. Market Positioning Map\n\n**Axes:**\n*   **X-Axis:** Content Creation Focus (Basic AI for Social <-------> Advanced AI for Long-Form Content)\n*   **Y-Axis:** Platform Integration & Scope (Standalone Tool <-------> All-in-One Marketing Platform)\n\n```\n        ^ Platform Integration & Scope (All-in-One Marketing Platform)\n        |\n        |      HubSpot Marketing Hub\n        |      (High integration, broad scope, good AI)\n        |\n        |             Application (Proposed Positioning)\n        |             (Strong Social Mgmt + AI Blog + WP)\n        |\n        |                               StoryChief\n        |                               (High integration for publishing, less AI)\n        |\n        |\nAgorapulse/Sprout Social -----(mid-line)------------------ Semrush CMP\n(Social-first, basic AI)         |                         (SEO-first, advanced AI for content)\n        |                        |\n        |                        |\n        |                 Jasper/Copy.ai\n        |                 (AI-first, limited integration)\n        |\n        +--------------------------------------------------------------> Content Creation Focus\n          (Basic AI for Social)                                          (Advanced AI for Long-Form Content)\n\n```\n\n**Positioning Description for \"Application\":**\n\n*   **Current Position (Estimated):** `Application` currently sits strong on the \"Platform Integration & Scope\" axis, closer to Agorapulse, but likely lacks the advanced AI for long-form content generation.\n*   **Target Positioning (With new feature):** The `Application` aims to position itself as the **\"Integrated Social & Content Powerhouse for Modern Marketers\"**. It will occupy the white space where robust social media management meets advanced AI blog generation and seamless WordPress publishing.\n    *   **Segment:** Small to medium-sized marketing teams, agencies, and content creators who need to manage their social presence effectively *and* produce high-quality, SEO-friendly blog content without juggling multiple expensive tools.\n    *   **Differentiation:** The key differentiator will be the *seamless workflow* from AI blog idea to social promotion, all within a single, user-friendly platform. It's not just an AI writer, and it's not just a social scheduler; it's a unified content engine.\n    *   **Opportunity:** The `Application` can capture market share from users who find HubSpot too comprehensive/expensive, Jasper too focused solely on writing, and traditional social media management tools lacking in long-form content capabilities."

Navigation Flow\n\n*   **Entry Points:**\n    *   **From \"My Blog Drafts\":** User clicks a \"New Blog Post\" button on the drafts list screen.\n    *   **From Main Navigation:** User selects \"Blog Posts\" from the main menu, then clicks an implicit \"New Blog Post\" action (or is redirected if no drafts exist).\n*   **Exit Points:**\n    *   **\"Back to Drafts\" Link:** Returns to the \"My Blog Drafts\" list without saving unsaved changes (with a confirmation prompt).\n    *   **\"Save Draft\" Button:** Stays on the current \"New Blog Post\" screen, showing a success message, and ensuring the draft is saved to \"My Blog Drafts\".\n    *   **\"Publish to WordPress\" Button:** Stays on the current \"New Blog Post\" screen, showing a success message and a link to the live post, and changes the internal status of the draft.\n    *   **\"Connect New WordPress Site\" Action:** Opens a modal or navigates to a separate \"Connect WordPress Site\" screen, returning to this screen upon completion.\n*   **Navigation Aids:** Breadcrumbs clearly show the user's path. A prominent \"Back to My Blog Drafts\" link is available.\n*   **Deep Links:** Not primarily applicable for a creation screen, but published posts could link back to their editable version.\n\n### 5. User Interactions\n\n*   **Topic Input:**\n    *   **Action:** User types text.\n    *   **Feedback:** Text appears in the input field.\n    *   **State:** Default, Focused, Empty (validation).\n*   **Generate Draft Button:**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks.\n    *   **Feedback:** Button enters a loading state (e.g., disabled, spinner appears).\n    *   **State:** Default, Hover, Active, Loading, Disabled (if input is empty).\n*   **AI Generation:**\n    *   **Action:** System generating.\n    *   **Feedback:** Loading spinner and \"Generating AI draft...\" message displayed prominently in the content area.\n    *   **State:** Loading.\n    *   **Success:** AI-generated content populates the title and editor, loading indicator disappears.\n    *   **Error:** Error message (\"Failed to generate...\") displayed if AI service fails.\n*   **Rich Text Editor (Toolbar Buttons):**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks a formatting button (e.g., Bold).\n    *   **Feedback:** Text in editor changes format; button highlights (active state).\n    *   **State:** Default, Hover, Active.\n*   **Rich Text Editor (Content Area):**\n    *   **Action:** User types, selects text.\n    *   **Feedback:** Text appears, selection highlights.\n    *   **State:** Default, Focused.\n*   **Save Draft Button:**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks.\n    *   **Feedback:** Button enters loading state briefly. Success toast/message (\"Draft saved!\") appears.\n    *   **State:** Default, Hover, Active, Loading.\n*   **WordPress Dropdowns (Site, Category, Status):**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks to open dropdown, selects an option.\n    *   **Feedback:** Dropdown opens, selection highlights, dropdown closes.\n    *   **State:** Default, Open, Selected.\n*   **Tags Input:**\n    *   **Action:** User types, system offers suggestions (if applicable).\n    *   **Feedback:** Text appears, suggestions display below input.\n    *   **State:** Default, Focused, With Suggestions.\n*   **Publish to WordPress Button:**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks.\n    *   **Feedback:** Button enters loading state briefly. Success toast/message (\"Blog published!\") appears with a link to the live post.\n    *   **State:** Default, Hover, Active, Loading, Disabled (if no WP site selected or other errors).\n    *   **Error:** Error toast/message (\"Failed to publish...\") if WordPress API fails.\n\n### 6. Accessibility Considerations\n\n*   **Keyboard Navigation:**\n    *   Tab order will logically follow the visual flow: App Header -> Breadcrumbs/Back Link -> Topic Input -> Generate Button -> Post Title Input -> Rich Text Editor Toolbar (left-to-right, then top-to-bottom) -> Rich Text Editor Content -> WordPress Site Selector -> Connect New WP Site -> Category Selector -> Tags Input -> Status Selector -> Save Draft Button -> Publish Button -> Footer.\n    *   All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links, dropdowns) must be reachable and operable via keyboard.\n*   **Screen Reader Support:**\n    *   All headings (H1/H2/H3) used semantically.\n    *   Labels are clearly associated with their input fields using `<label for=\"...\">`.\n    *   `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes for complex components like the rich text editor and dropdowns for clarity.\n    *   `aria-live=\"polite\"` for loading indicators and success/error messages to announce changes to screen readers.\n    *   Images/Icons in the rich text editor toolbar will have descriptive `alt` text or `aria-label`s.\n*   **Color Contrast:**\n    *   All text against its background must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for regular text, 3:1 for large text).\n    *   Interactive elements (buttons, links) will also have sufficient contrast in their default, hover, and active states.\n*   **Focus Indicators:**\n    *   Clear, visible focus outlines will be provided for all interactive elements when navigated via keyboard. This can be a distinct border, highlight, or shadow.\n*   **Alt Text:**\n    *   Any functional icons (e.g., those in the rich text editor toolbar) will have appropriate `alt` attributes or `aria-label`s.\n    *   Users inserting images will be prompted to provide alt text for accessibility.\n*   **Error Handling:** Error messages will be clear, concise, and programmatically associated with the input field they relate to, allowing screen readers to announce them effectively."

user-specific preferences and integrations, prominently featuring new sections for WordPress connections and AI generation settings.\n\n### 1. Screen Analysis\n\n*   **Screen: Settings**\n    *   **Purpose:** To serve as a central hub for users to view and modify all application-wide configurations, personal account details, security, billing, and the new AI Blog Generator and WordPress Publisher feature settings.\n    *   **User Goals:**\n        *   Update personal profile information (name, email).\n        *   Manage security settings (password change, 2FA).\n        *   Review subscription details and manage payment methods.\n        *   Connect new WordPress websites.\n        *   View, edit, or disconnect existing WordPress site connections.\n        *   Configure default AI generation parameters (e.g., content tone, desired length).\n        *   Manage other third-party integrations.\n    *   **User Context:** Users typically navigate to the Settings screen from the global application header (e.g., clicking their user profile icon or a \"Settings\" link). Their intent could range from a routine check of their profile to an urgent need to update billing or configure a new WordPress integration. They will primarily exit by selecting another main navigation item or using the browser's back functionality.\n    *   **Content Priority:**\n        *   **High:** User Profile, Security, WordPress Connections (adding, managing, disconnecting).\n        *   **Medium:** Billing & Plans, AI Generation Settings (setting defaults).\n        *   **Low:** Other Integrations (as generic placeholder).\n\n### 2. UI Elements Identification\n\n1.  **Element: App Header**\n    *   **Type:** Global Header\n    *   **Purpose:** Application branding, primary navigation access, and user profile shortcuts.\n    *   **Priority:** 5\n2.  **Element: Breadcrumbs**\n    *   **Type:** Text Link (e.g., \"Home > Settings\")\n    *   **Purpose:** Provides contextual navigation and indicates the user's current location within the application hierarchy.\n    *   **Priority:** 4\n3.  **Element: Settings Navigation (Sidebar)**\n    *   **Type:** Vertical Navigation List\n    *   **Purpose:** Allows users to efficiently switch between different categories of settings without reloading the entire page.\n    *   **Priority:** 1 (Navigational)\n4.  **Element: Nav Item (Profile, Security, Billing & Plans, WordPress Connections, AI Generation Settings, Other Integrations)**\n    *   **Type:** Link / Button (within Settings Navigation Sidebar)\n    *   **Purpose:** Each item serves as an entry point to a specific settings category.\n    *   **Priority (relative to feature):** WordPress Connections (1), AI Generation Settings (2), Profile (1), Security (2), Billing & Plans (3), Other Integrations (4).\n    *   **Accessibility:** Each link will have a clear, descriptive accessible name (`aria-label`) and `aria-current=\"page\"` when active.\n5.  **Element: Active Settings Section Title**\n    *   **Type:** H1 Heading (Dynamic)\n    *   **Purpose:** Clearly states the name of the currently active settings category, reinforcing user context.\n    *   **Priority:** 1\n6.  **Element: Sub-section Heading (e.g., \"Connected WordPress Sites\")**\n    *   **Type:** H2 Heading\n    *   **Purpose:** Organizes content within a larger settings category, breaking it into manageable sub-sections.\n    *   **Priority:** 2\n7.  **Element: Table/List of WP Sites**\n    *   **Type:** Data Table or Card List\n    *   **Purpose:** Displays a tabular or card-based view of all WordPress sites currently connected to the application, including their status.\n    *   **Priority:** 1 (Core content of the WordPress Connections section)\n    *   **Columns (if table):** Site URL, Connection Status, Actions (Edit, Disconnect).\n    *   **Accessibility:** Table headers will use `<th>` with `scope` attributes. Action buttons will have descriptive `aria-label`s.\n8.  **Element: Edit Button (for each WP site)**\n    *   **Type:** Secondary Button / Icon Button\n    *   **Purpose:** Allows users to modify details (e.g., refresh credentials) or settings for a specific connected WordPress site.\n    *   **Priority:** 3\n    *   **Accessibility:** `aria-label=\"Edit connection for [Site URL]\"`\n9.  **Element: Disconnect Button (for each WP site)**\n    *   **Type:** Destructive Button / Icon Button\n    *   **Purpose:** Allows users to securely remove a connected WordPress site. This action will typically require a confirmation step.\n    *   **Priority:** 3\n    *   **Accessibility:** `aria-label=\"Disconnect [Site URL]\"`\n10. **Element: \"+ Connect New WordPress Site\" Button**\n    *   **Type:** Primary Button\n    *   **Purpose:** Initiates the workflow for adding a new WordPress site connection to the application.\n    *   **Priority:** 2\n    *   **Accessibility:** `aria-label=\"Connect a New WordPress Site\"`\n11. **Element: Sub-section Heading (e.g., \"AI Generation Settings\")**\n    *   **Type:** H2 Heading\n    *   **Purpose:** Title for the default AI content generation settings.\n    *   **Priority:** 2\n12. **Element: Default Tone Label + Dropdown**\n    *   **Type:** Label & Dropdown Selector\n    *   **Purpose:** Allows users to set a preferred default tone for all AI-generated blog posts.\n    *   **Priority:** 3\n    *   **Accessibility:** Label is linked to the dropdown; dropdown has `aria-label=\"Default AI Generation Tone\"`.\n13. **Element: Default Length Label + Dropdown/Slider**\n    *   **Type:** Label & Dropdown Selector or Slider\n    *   **Purpose:** Allows users to set a preferred default length range for AI-generated blog posts.\n    *   **Priority:** 3\n    *   **Accessibility:** Label is linked to the control; control has `aria-label=\"Default AI Generation Length\"`.\n14. **Element: Save AI Settings Button**\n    *   **Type:** Primary Button\n    *   **Purpose:** Saves the configured default AI generation settings.\n    *   **Priority:** 1 (for this specific settings section)\n    *   **Accessibility:** `aria-label=\"Save AI Generation Settings\"`\n15. **Element: Global Footer**\n    *   **Type:** Footer\n    *   **Purpose:** Contains copyright information and secondary legal or help links.\n    *   **Priority:** 5\n\n### 3. Layout Structure\n\n*   **Grid System:** Assumes a 12-column responsive grid for desktop, adapting to smaller breakpoints.\n*   **Content Zones:**\n    *   **Header (Full Width):** Consistent global header.\n    *   **Breadcrumbs (Full Width):** Placed directly below the header for navigational context.\n    *   **Settings Navigation Sidebar (Desktop: ~25% Width):**\n        *   Positioned on the left, containing a list of `Nav Item` links.\n        *   This area is visually distinct, acting as the primary navigation for settings categories.\n        *   It should remain fixed or sticky on scroll for desktop to allow easy switching between sections.\n    *   **Settings Content Area (Desktop: ~75% Width):**\n        *   Positioned on the right, dynamically displaying content based on the selected `Nav Item`.\n        *   Each content section begins with an `Active Settings Section Title` (H1), followed by relevant `Sub-section Heading` (H2s) and associated UI elements (tables, forms, buttons).\n        *   Content within sections (e.g., the WordPress sites list or AI settings form) will utilize vertical stacking and appropriate spacing.\n    *   **Footer (Full Width):** Consistent global footer.\n*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The two-column layout immediately establishes the primary navigation (left) and the detailed content (right). The `Active Settings Section Title` and `Sub-section Headings` guide the user through the specific content. Primary action buttons (`+ Connect New WordPress Site`, `Save AI Settings`) are designed for prominence within their respective sections.\n*   **Spacing:** Generous padding around major content zones and internal spacing between elements (e.g., form fields, buttons) to improve readability and reduce visual clutter. Vertical spacing ensures clear separation between sub-sections.\n*   **Responsive Behavior:**\n    *   **Mobile (Small Screens):** The `Settings Navigation` sidebar will transform. It could become a full-width dropdown selector at the top of the screen (e.g., \"Settings: [Dropdown of categories]\") or a slide-in overlay menu. The `Settings Content Area` will expand to full width, with sections and elements stacking vertically.\n    *   **Tables:** The `Table/List of WP Sites` will likely convert from a traditional table to a card-based layout, where each card represents a WordPress site and contains its details and action buttons.\n    *   **Form Fields:** Input fields and dropdowns will occupy full width or adjust proportionally.\n\n### 4. Navigation Flow\n\n*   **Entry Points:**\n    *   **Global Header:** Clicking the user profile icon or a dedicated \"Settings\" link.\n    *   **Direct Link:** Potentially via a deep link from another part of the application or an email.\n*   **Exit Points:**\n    *   **Main Navigation:** Clicking any primary navigation item (e.g., \"Dashboard,\" \"Campaigns\") in the global header.\n    *   **Browser Back Button:** Returns to the previously viewed screen.\n    *   **Within Settings:** Clicking a different `Nav Item` in the sidebar essentially 'exits' the current section's content and 'enters' a new one.\n*   **Navigation Aids:**\n    *   **Breadcrumbs:** \"Home > Settings\" provides context.\n    *   **Settings Navigation Sidebar:** The primary means of navigating between different categories of settings, with the active item clearly highlighted.\n*   **Deep Links:** Specific settings categories (e.g., `/settings/wordpress` or `/settings/ai-generation`) could be directly accessible via deep links.\n\n### 5. User Interactions\n\n*   **Settings Navigation Item Click:**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks a `Nav Item` (e.g., \"WordPress Connections\").\n    *   **Feedback:** The clicked item visually highlights, and the `Settings Content Area` dynamically updates to display the corresponding content. The `Active Settings Section Title` changes.\n    *   **State:** Default, Hover, Active (highlighted).\n*   **Form Field Interaction (e.g., Default Tone/Length):**\n    *   **Action:** User types, selects an option from a dropdown, or interacts with a slider.\n    *   **Feedback:** Field shows a focus state, input appears, dropdown options expand/collapse, selection is highlighted.\n    *   **State:** Default, Focused, Edited, Disabled.\n*   **\"+ Connect New WordPress Site\" Button:**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks.\n    *   **Feedback:** A modal dialog or a new screen appears, prompting for WordPress site details (URL, username, application password).\n    *   **State:** Default, Hover, Active.\n*   **\"Edit\" Button (for WP site):**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks an `Edit` button for a specific WordPress site.\n    *   **Feedback:** A modal or an inline form appears, pre-populated with the site's current connection details for modification.\n    *   **State:** Default, Hover, Active.\n*   **\"Disconnect\" Button (for WP site):**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks a `Disconnect` button for a specific WordPress site.\n    *   **Feedback:** A confirmation modal appears, requesting verification before proceeding with disconnection (e.g., \"Are you sure you want to disconnect [Site URL]?\"). If confirmed, the site is removed from the list, and a success message appears.\n    *   **State:** Default, Hover, Active.\n*   **Save Buttons (e.g., \"Save AI Settings\"):**\n    *   **Action:** User clicks.\n    *   **Feedback:** The button enters a loading state (e.g., disabled, spinner within button). A success toast or in-page message (\"Settings saved successfully!\") appears. If validation errors occur, error messages appear next to relevant fields.\n    *   **State:** Default, Hover, Active, Loading, Disabled (if no changes or invalid input).\n*   **Error States:**\n    *   **Feedback:** Input fields with validation errors will typically show a red border/highlight. Clear, concise error messages (e.g., \"Invalid URL format,\" \"Please select a tone\") will be displayed below the affected input field or as an alert at the top of the content area.\n*   **Loading States:**\n    *   **Feedback:** Spinners or progress bars will indicate ongoing processes (e.g., connecting a new WordPress site, saving settings). Buttons involved in these processes will be disabled during loading.\n\n### 6. Accessibility Considerations\n\n*   **Keyboard Navigation:**\n    *   The tab order will follow a logical sequence: Global Header elements -> Breadcrumbs -> `Settings Navigation` sidebar (top to bottom) -> then into the active `Settings Content Area` (top to bottom, left to right for interactive elements).\n    *   All interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields, dropdowns) must be reachable and fully operable using only the keyboard.\n*   **Screen Reader Support:**\n    *   All headings (`H1`, `H2`) will be used semantically to provide a clear content structure for screen reader users.\n    *   Labels will be programmatically associated with their corresponding form input fields using `<label for=\"...\">`.\n    *   `aria-current=\"page\"` will be used on the active link within the `Settings Navigation` to inform screen reader users of their current location.\n    *   Complex interactive elements (like icon buttons for 'Edit' or 'Disconnect') will have descriptive `aria-label` attributes (e.g., `aria-label=\"Edit connection for example.com/blog/\"`).\n    *   Dynamic content updates (e.g., success messages, error alerts, loading states) will use `aria-live=\"polite\"` regions to ensure screen readers announce these changes effectively.\n*   **Color Contrast:**\n    *   All text (including headings, labels, button text) and interactive UI components (borders, backgrounds of buttons/links) will meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio requirements (minimum 4.5:1 for regular text, 3:1 for large text or graphical objects).\n    *   Focus indicators and active states will also have sufficient contrast to be easily discernible.\n*   **Focus Indicators:**\n    *   All interactive elements will have clear, distinct visual focus indicators (e.g., a strong border, highlight, or subtle shadow) when navigated via keyboard. This helps users understand which element is currently active.\n*   **Alt Text:**\n    *   Any functional icons (e.g., in `Edit` or `Disconnect` buttons) will have appropriate `alt` attributes or `aria-label`s.\n*   **Error Handling:** Error messages will be clear, concise, and programmatically linked to their associated input fields using `aria-describedby` or similar techniques, allowing screen readers to announce the error when the user focuses on the invalid field."
